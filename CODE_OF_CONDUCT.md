# Code of Conduct for Individual Developers

## Commitment

As participants, contributors, and leaders in this project, we are committed to fostering a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of personal attributes or background. We promise to create a community free from harassment and discrimination.

Our actions will be aimed at building a community that is open, friendly, diverse, inclusive, and healthy.

## Expected Behaviors

Positive contributions to our community include:

* Showing empathy and kindness to others
* Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
* Offering and accepting constructive criticism
* Taking responsibility for our actions, apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from them
* Prioritizing the well-being of the entire community over individual interests

Behaviors that are not acceptable:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention
* Insulting remarks, trolling, or politically charged attacks
* Harassment in any form
* Disclosing someone's private information without their explicit consent
* Any other actions that would be inappropriate in a professional context

## Enforcement Role

Project leaders are tasked with clarifying and upholding our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take fair corrective measures in response to any conduct they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the authority to modify, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct, and will explain moderation decisions when necessary.

## Applicability

This Code of Conduct is relevant in all project spaces, as well as when an individual is representing the project in public areas. Representation of the project can be through using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at events, either online or offline.

## Enforcement Process

Leaders will adhere to these guidelines when determining the consequences for actions deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Engaging in language or behavior that's unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Response**: A private warning from leaders, with an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be required.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A single incident or repeated actions that violate community standards.

**Response**: A warning with repercussions for continued misconduct. This includes no interaction with those involved, including those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a set time. This may lead to a temporary or permanent exclusion from the community.

### 3. Temporary Exclusion

**Impact**: Major breaches of community standards, including ongoing inappropriate conduct.

**Response**: A temporary prohibition from any interaction or public communication with the community for a certain period. No interaction with those involved is allowed during this time. This may escalate to a permanent exclusion for further violations.

### 4. Permanent Exclusion

**Impact**: Repeated violations of community standards, including persistent inappropriate behavior, harassment, or discrimination.

**Response**: A permanent ban from any public involvement in the community.
